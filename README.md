Docker container for sal + Sal-WHDImport + JSSImport

Instructions for using this coming soon, but this is a Docker container that pulls from [Sal](https://github.com/macadmins/sal), incorporates [Sal-WHD](https://github.com/nmcspadden/Sal-WHDImport) and [Sal-JSS](https://github.com/nmcspadden/Sal-JSSImport).
